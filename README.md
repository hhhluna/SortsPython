# Python Sorts

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Python. Each Python file corresponds to a different sorting algorithm.

## Sorting Algorithms Included:

- **Bubble Sort**: Sorts a list by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each item into its correct position.
- **Linear Sort**: Sorts a list by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the list.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the list into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: Chooses a "pivot" element from the list and partitions the other elements into two sub-lists according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-sorts.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-sorts

3. Run the Python files to see the sorting algorithms in action:
   ```bash
   python Bubble\ Sort.py
   python Insertion\ Sort.py
   python Linear\ Sort.py
   python Merge\ Sort.py
   python Quick\ Sort.py
